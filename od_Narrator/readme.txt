Spoiler warning for The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe!

Greetings, and welcome to The Narrator, your new Desktop Assistant and Companion! Read this all-encompassing instruction manual (well, maybe not ALL-encompassing) and make sure to keep the Narrator in tip-top shape!

-Chapter 1: The Basics-
My second ever ghost! Welcome to The Narrator ghost! The Narrator rambles and blabs on your screen and you can pet him on their head and face (by dragging the mouse along his head, or using the mouse wheel). He's not very comfortable with pets at first, though... Don't hit him or else he- Why did I get cut off? Nevermind, anyway you can also double click his buttons for fun. He goes by he/they pronouns. He has multiple expressions: embarrassed, surprised, worried, sad, determined, happy (based on the pretty lights part of the Zending), angry, thoughtful, and unamused.

If you double click anywhere else on The Narrator, a menu appears which you can use to give 'em gifts, hear what's on his mind currently, hear the last thing they said, ask him questions, have them ask you a question, play some games with him (in Do some stuff), have them insult you, vent at him, or ask about his life. In the Functions menu, you can report a bug or update him. 

There may or may not be a relationship (and mood) level thing, as well as an extra character... ;)

-Chapter 2: The Hotkeys-
t - talk
r - repeat what he said last
f1 - open readme (this file!)

-Chapter 3: The Credits-
Reviews from Steam/Pressurized Gas
Relationship code taken and modified from OKUAJUB's Snake and Otacon
Twinkling Galaxy Hues Balloon, mocking text code, capitalize text code, and minigames by Zichqec! https://ukagaka.zichqec.com/
Shakespearean insults by Jerry Maguire of Center Grove High School, Greenwood Indiana
Thank you! :D

-Chapter 4: The Terms-

This ghost is redistributable, but don't delete anything! You can fix minor errors (typos, etc.), but be sure to add a notice that you did so in this Readme. You don't have to give me credit, but if you want to, just put this somewhere in the readme, or the page where you have it for download: Created by Odie Dog at Ladybug Lane. You can copy this as a template to make your own ghost for some reason, though, instead of the amazing one at: http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html, by Zarla, or one of the templates by Zichqec, which I recommend you use instead. :P

-Chapter 5: The Version History-

Ver 0.1 - First beta release. (Tue, Feb 14, 2023 ;))
Ver 0.2 - Second beta release. (Wed, Mar 1, 2023)
Ver 1.0 - First public release! Various bugs fixed (with some at least being temporarily worked around). Custom cursor, mouse wheel, a couple chains, and misc stuff added. (Thur, Mar 9, 2023)
Ver 1.1 - Appended blinking to other surfaces, fixed some typos, and added some dialogue. (Mon, Apr 3, 2023)
Ver 1.2 - Stanley returns! Added unlockable secondary character, who only likes pets on the head, not the face. Also added more emotions for the Narrator, some extra dialogue, and tweaked the relationship and mood stuff. (Wed, May 3, 2023)
Ver 1.3 - Tweaked the relationship and mood stuff again: specifically, every hour his feelings and mood increase by 5 now, giving him a wallpaper or screensaver increases 'em by 5, and playing games with him increases the relationship level and mood more depending on the difficulty of the game. He now remembers if you've reset him or not. Added a couple of new menu options to Stanley. Also added more dialogue, and made some dialogue require a certain friendliness level or mood level. (Sat, Aug 27, 2023)
Ver 1.4 - Added new dialogue including a new story by The Narrator, added a talking animation for the Narrator, and added more talk rates. (Mon, May 19, 2025)
