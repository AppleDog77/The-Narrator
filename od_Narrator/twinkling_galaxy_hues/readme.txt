A small galaxy balloon for your galaxy balloon needs! Uses the new font outline option for improved readability, and only includes balloons for the sakura, so if it doesn't work you might need to update your SSP. Please note that there is also a bug in versions of SSP older than 2.5.51 where the online marker would be flipped backwards.

There are three sizes of balloon, b0, b2, and b4. When in online mode, the background stars will twinkle!
